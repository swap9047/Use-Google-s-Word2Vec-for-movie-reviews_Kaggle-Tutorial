# Use-Google-s-Word2Vec-for-movie-reviews_Kaggle-Tutorial
In this tutorial competition, we dig a little "deeper" into sentiment analysis. Google's Word2Vec is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis.

 Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will help you get started with Word2Vec for natural language processing. It has two goals: 

Basic Natural Language Processing: Part 1 of this tutorial is intended for beginners and covers basic natural language processing techniques, which are needed for later parts of the tutorial.

Deep Learning for Text Understanding: In Parts 2 and 3, we delve into how to train a model using Word2Vec and how to use the resulting word vectors for sentiment analysis.

Since deep learning is a rapidly evolving field, large amounts of the work has not yet been published, or exists only as academic papers. Part 3 of the tutorial is more exploratory than prescriptive -- we experiment with several ways of using Word2Vec rather than giving you a recipe for using the output.

To achieve these goals, we rely on an IMDB sentiment analysis data set, which has 100,000 multi-paragraph movie reviews, both positive and negative.
